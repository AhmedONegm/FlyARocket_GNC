This project presents the cumulative effort of an Undergraduate student team to design, build and fly the first ever recorded attempt to actively stabiilize a model rocket with an (R)eaction (C)ontrol (S)system. The end goal is to have 3 successful demonstration flights with the R\-C\-S control activated that show the rocket being maintained in the upright vertical orientation during the few seconds of low velocity around apogee. The testbed vehicle, the (F)light (A)ttitude (L)inearly (C)controlled (4)th iteration (F\-A\-L\-C\-O-\/4) rocket, is the own design of the student team and has been made specifically to carry the R\-C\-S system and supporting avionics at a minimum size and cost.\hypertarget{index_Contributors}{}\section{Contributors}\label{index_Contributors}
